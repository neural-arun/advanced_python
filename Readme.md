# Advanced Python 🐍

This repository documents my **hands-on journey from Python fundamentals to async-first backend development**.

The goal is not just to “learn Python”, but to **build production-ready thinking** required for:

* Backend APIs (FastAPI)
* Web scraping systems
* Async I/O–heavy applications
* Real-world automation and freelance work

This repo evolves as I learn — it’s a **living codebase**, not a finished course.

## 🔗 Why This Repo Exists

This is not tutorial code.

This is:

* How I **think**
* How I **practice**
* How I prepare for **real backend systems**
